🩺 Breast Cancer Detection with Machine Learning

Breast cancer is a major threat to women’s health, but early detection improves survival.  
This project develops a **machine learning pipeline** using **Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA) biopsy data** to classify tumors as benign or malignant.

- 📊 Tested models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, k-NN, ANN, and SVM  
- 🧠 Best model: **SVM with RBF kernel** (97% accuracy)  
- 🔑 Key features: radius, texture, concavity, perimeter  
- 🌍 Application: reduces diagnosis errors and supports low-resource healthcare settings
