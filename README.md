# Breast Cancer Detection

This project uses machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, k-NN, ANN, and SVM) on FNA biopsy data to classify breast cancer tumors.

- Best model: **SVM with RBF kernel** (97% accuracy)
- Features: radius, texture, concavity, perimeter
- Potential: early detection & support in low-resource settings
